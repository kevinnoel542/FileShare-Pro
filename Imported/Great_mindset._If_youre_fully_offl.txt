Great mindset. If you’re fully offline, your website becomes a **LAN-powered local file sharing tool**, so we’ll focus on features that:

* Work **entirely in the browser**
* Use **Python + Flask only locally**
* Rely on **no internet or remote APIs**
* Make your app feel like a **professional offline tool**

---

## 🔧 Advanced Offline-Only Features (Level Up Your App)

### 🗃️ 1. **Local History Log (All Devices)**

* Save uploads/downloads in a local SQLite or JSON file.
* Log: filename, size, time, IP of device
* Show a "History" page listing all actions.

👉 *Optional*: Let users export the history to `.csv`.

---

### 🔒 2. **Local Device Whitelist / Blocklist**

* Allow only specific IPs or devices to upload/download.
* Store allowed/blocked IPs in a file.
* Flask checks `request.remote_addr`.

---

### 🔁 3. **File Preview (for Images, PDFs, Videos, Text)**

* Before downloading, show:

  * Image preview (JPEG, PNG)
  * PDF preview (via browser viewer)
  * Text file preview (with syntax highlight)
  * MP4/WebM video preview

> All can be rendered in-browser using HTML5 — fully offline.

---

### 🧩 4. **Offline Plugin System (User-defined Python tools)**

* Let users drop `.py` scripts into a `/plugins` folder.
* Examples:

  * Auto-compress images
  * Add watermark
  * Encrypt files with password before sending
* Flask loads and runs these as hooks on upload.

---

### 💬 5. **Offline Chat or Message Board**

* Mini real-time chat or message feed:

  * Store messages locally (JSON or SQLite)
  * Use JavaScript to poll or use WebSocket (still on localhost)
  * Devices on the same LAN can communicate

> Can be helpful if you’re sending files and need basic chat too.

---

### 🗂️ 6. **Offline ZIP Extraction**

* Upload `.zip` files and extract them server-side
* Show file list inside, allow downloading individual files

---

### 🎚️ 7. **Local Device Limits**

* Set per-device upload limits:

  * Max file size per upload (e.g., 100MB)
  * Max files per session/IP
* Block over-quota devices (store limits in config)

---

### 🖨️ 8. **Print-Friendly File Receipt**

* After uploading/downloading:

  * Show a receipt with file name, size, IP, time
  * Option to print or save as PDF
* All done client-side or using Flask’s PDF generator (e.g., `WeasyPrint`)

---

### 🎯 9. **LAN Auto-Discovery of Other Devices**

* Send broadcast message from Flask:

  * “FileShare available at `192.168.X.X:5000`”
* Devices can discover others via LAN broadcast.

👉 Advanced, but cool for shared spaces.

---

### 💻 10. **Desktop Mode (via PWA or Python Wrapper)**

* Make it installable like an app:

  * Add PWA manifest (for browser install)
  * Or wrap in PyInstaller + Flask + Electron/Tauri for native app feel
